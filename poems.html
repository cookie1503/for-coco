          We'll go through all the good and <br>

          from me, just the way you are. <br>
          But we walk on the same land and sleep <br>
          under the same sky. <br>
          Maybe the air I am breathing right now <br>
          would pass through your alveoli. <br>
          And that'd be our kiss until we see each other <br>
          next time.</p>

        <p>Far from the cities, <br>
          Amongst the rolling hills. <br>

        <p>Far from the cities, <br>
          Amongst the rolling hills. <br>
          At the bottom of the vale, <br>
          Engulfed by pine trees, would rest a calm lake. <br>
          On its edge would be a magnificent cottage, <br>
          Which would be our abode. <br>
          We’ll have a dog that’ll keep guard at night, <br>
          And a white-furred cat to scare away the mice. <br>
          The mornings would be late, <br>
          And the afternoons would be slothful. <br>
          And the evenings would be wasted, <br>
          Getting high off your beautiful, sparkling eyes. <br>
          When the sun goes home and the moonlight illumes the night, <br>
          We’ll go skinny dipping under the risqué gaze of the stars high up in the sky, <br>
          Holding your hand in my left and in my right hand a bottle of wine. <br>
          You’ll be wearing the moonlight and I’ll be wearing a smile. <br>
          All my intoxication would be lost on the gateway to your soul. <br>
          Hands do the exploring and ours legs entwined, <br>
          Feeling each other until the end of time. <br>
          I carry you to the bed and the clouds shed tears in grief, <br>
          Because of your beauty, they’ll no longer be able to see. <br>
          Wrapping a fluffy blanket I cuddle you to keep away the cold, <br>
          And make love to you until our souls amalgamate. <br>
          Wake up the next day, the sun shining bright. <br>
          And I look at you with the same thoughts in my mind, <br>
          “I can’t believe such a beautiful girl is all mine.”</p>

          A prince, a princess, the king and the queen <br>

          If we can be together <br>
